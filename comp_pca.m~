%   X:  N x D matrix (double)
% Output:
%   EVecs: D-by-D matrix (double) contains all eigenvectors as columns
%       NB: follow the Task 1.3 specifications on eigenvectors.
%   EVals:
%       Eigenvalues in descending order, D x 1 vector (double)
%   (Note that the i-th columns of Evecs should corresponds to the i-th element in EVals)
